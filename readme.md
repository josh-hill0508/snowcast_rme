I have had problems setting up my machine and compiling using the container, but I have put thought into the design of my server. There will be one main thread handling the distribution of work. This main thread will set other threads on their respective goroutine to carry out the work for each client and station. As a a result, there will be one thread per client and one thread per station. Inside each client thread, the server will store basic information about the client's connection to the server, and what station the client is currently listening to. For each station, the server must store the data describing what song is currently being played. I will use a mutex lock to protect the shared queue of which clients each station will be assigned (play to). When a client changes stations, the server will need to change which station a client socket is assigned to.
